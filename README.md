## Description

This is a React application / website for displaying information about dog kennel and dog show events. It uses `axios` for making HTTP requests, `react-bootstrap` for UI components, and `json-server` for mocking a backend server.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- **axios**: For making HTTP requests.
- **react-bootstrap**: For UI components.
- **emailjs-com**: For sending emails in ContactUs page.
- **json-server**: For mocking the backend server with a `db.json` file included in the public directory.

## Installation

1. **Mock Backend JSON Server**

   A simple yet powerful tool for frontend developers to create a mock REST backend server API for development and testing purposes. It allows to develop a full fake REST API and supports common HTTP methods like the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, just like a real backend API server would. And React CRUD applications that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data based on search queries.

2. npm install axios react-bootstrap emailjs-com json-server

   Following json-server installation in the project directory
   Open new Command Prompt or PowerShell window
   And run following command in the project directory to 
   start JSON server before starting your React application in the second Command Prompt:

   ## `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`

3. JSON Server Endpoint:

   http://localhost:5000/shows

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, while JSON Server is running, you can run in the second Command Prompt:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
